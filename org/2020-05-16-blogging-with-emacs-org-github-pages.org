When I chose hosting and content management solutions for this website, I knew
the blog portion would be the hardest.  A bio page, a link to my GitHub profile,
these are easy.  But blogs are dynamic, and require much more background logic
to manage.  I made my hosting and content management decisions very
deliberately, and I wanted to do a rundown of my setup in case anyone else finds
it useful.

* My Needs

**  Emacs at the Center
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] is an interesting piece of software for its versatility.  I've used it for
[[https://www.xkcd.com/224/][Lisp]] development, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/][playing music]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html][chatting on IRC]], and dozens of other
needs.[fn:1] It's long been my LaTeX editor of choice, but I've also taken to
using [[http://orgmode.org/][Org]] for more casual writing (e.g. "Hey Carl, can you give me your thoughts
on this paper?").  Increasingly, Emacs has replaced more and more of my
userspace, and doing any sort of real work outside of it is a major point of
friction.  I wasn't going to blog without it, so I needed a system that would
let me work in plain text, ideally using Org as a markdown language.  WordPress
has caused me to lose patience with browser-based WYSIWYG editors.
 
**  Self-Contained...Sort of
I use several computers, and I value my time.  I maintain my Emacs config across
machines, but the last thing I'm looking for is to manually download unsupported
tarballs and rejigger some Ruby blogging environment on each computer.  The
dream is that writing a new post entails opening Emacs, visiting a new Org file,
and writing immediately.  Visible PHP anywhere?  Dealbreaker.

**  Cost
Cheap is good.  Free (as in beer) is better.  I already sprung for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_Island][Ascension
Island]] vanity URL.

* GitHub Pages
[[https://pages.github.com/][GitHub Pages]] is a slick way to use [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]], a snappy and beautiful static site
generator, while abstracting away all of the nitty gritty.  There's a large
community around the product, which has led to the development of some wonderful
starter kits that amount to:
1. Fork the repo (I use Dean Attali's [[http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/][Beautiful Jekyll]]).
2. Change Dean's name to yours.
3. Add static pages, blog, create buttons to your GitHub or an RSS feed, it's yours now.
The entire site exists in a Git repository, making it incredibly portable, and
builds happen from Emacs.  If I want to edit it from a new machine, all I need
to do is clone the repository!  The whole setup is very off-the-shelf, which is
exactly what I want.

GitHub Pages is free with [[https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/][limits]] I find acceptable.  In particular, it's a
strong fit if your bandwidth demands are "no one will read this but I could
conceivably write something that Hacker News might like."  My greatest complaint
is what while custom domains are supported, they do not currently allow HTTPS, a
decision I hope they will reevaluate.  [[https://pages.gitlab.io/][GitLab Pages]] is a similar offering with
more features and flexibility, but I am not aware of a setup as painless as the
above, as when I looked it required much more configuration.

**  Version Control (Magit)
Predictably, GitHub Pages usage revolves around Git.  It's probably good
practice for a personal website to live inside a version control system,
preventing me from breaking anything too badly, and GitHub Pages makes it a
prerequisite.  Git is a scary piece of software, living in the terminal and
having some admittedly abstruse commands, hence why GitHub puts so much effort
into shiny desktop frontends.  [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is an Emacs interface for Git, and it's
remarkably effective and simple.  I hardly use any of its functionality, but for
all my staging, pushing, and pulling needs, Magit makes it a few simple
keypresses, being too convenient for me to bother learning Git from the command
line.  Hooray!

* Org
If you ask people what the killer feature of Emacs is, the two answers you'll
hear most often are its hackability through Lisp and Org-mode.  Some people live
their lives out of Org files.  Writing in Org is more quotidien.

This post is not a guide to Org.  If you need a reference, the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/][manual]] is
excellent to brush up on [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Plain-lists.html#Plain-lists][lists]] or [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Emphasis-and-monospace.html#Emphasis-and-monospace][fontification]] or even [[http://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-items.html#TODO-items][TODO]] items.  I'm just
going to talk about some of the more intermediate functionality I use in this
blog.

** Exporting to Jekyll
Org-mode has robust exporting capabilities.  And [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html][very thorough documentation,
even for niche cases like this]].  While Jekyll expects HTML documents as its
input, I'm writing in Org.  Org-exports to HTML, but to run a blog requires
slightly more work.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(("carl.ac"
         ;; Path to org files.
         :base-directory "~/carldotac.github.io/org"
         :base-extension "org"

         ;; Path to Jekyll Posts
         :publishing-directory "~/carldotac.github.io/_posts/"
         :recursive t
         :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
         :headline-levels 4
         :html-extension "html"
         :body-only t
         )))
#+END_SRC

Now Emacs will update the posts with =C-c-e P p=.

Jekyll also expects files to be named in the form =yyyy-mm-dd-post_name.html=.
The .html suffix is handled by the exporter, but I am proud to say I can handle
writing the date all by myself.

Post metadata is fairly self-explanatory.  Jekyll has a certain format, and I
put a block like this at the top of each post so that Org will leave it alone in
the export.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
---
layout: post
title: "Blogging with Emacs, Org, and GitHub Pages"
permalink: /:title/
tags: [emacs]

#+END_EXPORT
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Code
Org's support for code blocks is outstanding, with all the languages I'm ever
going to use, but I don't need [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] features here.  I just want
syntax highlighting, which requires blocks (and maybe also the [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize]]
package--if it's not working, install that).  This

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC R
players <- read.csv("offensive_stats_2016.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

becomes this.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
players <- read.csv("offensive_stats_2016.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
#+END_SRC

** Links and Images
Inserting a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)][link]] is easy.  =C-c-l= calls =org-insert-link=, which will ask for a
link (which supports a number of protocols, not just http/https) and then the
text to link.  If you're not into letting Emacs improve your workflow, the
underlying syntax is as follows.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjHOtxCRhnw][Mattingly's finest hour]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Images don't get a special function.  I could write one, and almost did to make
a point after writing that previous sentence, but decided not to bother.  Images
are inserted with a path in double brackets, and since I have an image directory
under version control, I just need to insert the relative path.  So to show off
my devilishly handsome mug, I invoke =counsel-find-file=, navigate to the desired
photo, and use a [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InsertFileName][special function]] to insert the relative file path (I use the
Ivy code, which does all the hard stuff to insert an image), and then

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[../img/avatar-icon.png]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

becomes me.

[[../img/avatar-icon.png]]
** Tables
Org's table editor is excellent and I have a habit of inserting the plain text
tables into emails and the like.[fn:2] It exports beautifully to HTML.  Invoke
=M-x org-table-create= and then this

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Player       | Games |  fWAR |
|--------------+-------+-------|
| Babe Ruth    |  2503 | 168.4 |
| Barry Bonds  |  2986 | 164.4 |
| Willie Mays  |  2992 | 149.9 |
| Ty Cobb      |  3035 | 149.3 |
| Honus Wagner |  2792 | 138.1 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

turns into this.

| Player       | Games |  fWAR |
|--------------+-------+-------|
| Babe Ruth    |  2503 | 168.4 |
| Barry Bonds  |  2986 | 164.4 |
| Willie Mays  |  2992 | 149.9 |
| Ty Cobb      |  3035 | 149.3 |
| Honus Wagner |  2792 | 138.1 |

When editing the tables, Org can automatically realign the plain text columns
with =C-c-c=, a nice quality-of-life function.

** Footnotes: Not Just for Academic Papers!
I might[fn:3] abuse footnotes.  Why wouldn't I, when they're this easy?  =C-c-x f=
creates a new footnote and the exported document will have links between the
in-text number and the footnote content.  Plus =M-x org-footnote-renumber-fn:N=
can renumber and reorder your footnotes should you write out of order or add a
new footnote between existing ones.

* Concluding Comments
Despite the number of moving pieces here, this setup has an ideal balance of
simplicity in both setup and use.  Maintenance, including security, is
completely hands off, writing posts with all sorts of content is painless thanks
to Emacs integration.  I hope to keep this setup for a long time, and I'm
pleased to see how achievable that should be.

* Footnotes
[fn:1] Not [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/26559/how-do-i-play-tetris-in-emacs][Tetris]] anymore, though. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo_Tetris][Puyo Puyo Tetris]] has me covered there.

[fn:2] I wonder how people respond to those perfectly formatted, entirely
uncommon tables in an email, but they're easy to read and don't need HTML, so
they stay.

[fn:3] I definitely do.
