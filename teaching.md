## Core courses

*Financial Markets*: This course introduces finance theory and describes
economics of bond, equity, FX and derivatives markets. This course forms the
foundation for all subsequent finance courses. I regularly teach this course in
our on-campus long duration and online/blended learning programs.

*Corporate Finance*: This course covers the principal decisions in corporate
finance -- working capital management, investment and financing decisions,
mergers and acquisitions, capital structure, dividend policy and risk
management. I regularly teach this course in our on-campus long duration and
online/blended learning programs.

*Macroeconomics and Economic Policy*: Why do some countries grow at a faster
rate than others? Why are there inflation, unemployment and recessions? What are
the sources of these aggregate economic fluctuations? Can the government
policymakers do something about them? Should they? This course provides a
framework to start thinking about these questions. It introduces students to the
definition and measurement of aggregate variables such as income and
expenditure, inflation and unemployment, and then develop a conceptual framework
that provides insights into the determinants of these aggregate measures that
macroeconomics concerns itself with. The course will also include an analysis of
the role of government and central bank with reference to monetary, fiscal and
foreign exchange rate policies. I last taught this course in 2013.
