## C. Current core courses

**C3. Corporate Finance**: This MBA course covers the principal decisions in
corporate finance -- working capital management, investment and financing
decisions, mergers and acquisitions, capital structure, dividend policy and risk
management. I regularly teach this course in our on-campus long duration and
online/blended learning programs.

**C2. Asset Pricing**: This PhD course introduces the theory of financial
economics and the language of modern asset pricing in discrete time. The course
adopts the state price and stochastic discount factor approaches to asset
pricing based on expected utility theory. Within this framework, the course
covers the classical mean variance models including the CAPM and APT as well as
the inter-temporal consumption based asset pricing model. The entire course is
based on a discrete time and mostly discrete state space setting, with a focus
on equity markets. The course ends with a survey of stylized facts and issues in
empirical asset pricing.

**C1. Financial Markets**: This MBA course introduces finance theory and
describes economics of bond, equity, FX and derivatives markets. This compulsory
course forms the foundation for all subsequent finance courses. I regularly
teach this course in our on-campus long duration and online/blended learning
programs.

## E. Current elective courses (in descending order of their offering)

**E5. Black Swans and Gray Rhinos**: Made popular by Nicholas Nassim Taleb,
"black swans" has long been used as a metaphor in financial markets for rare and
almost impossible-to-predict large shocks. Noticing that often many crisis are a
result of ignoring the obvious, Michel Wucker coined the "gray rhinos" metaphor
to capture that many large problems are often well in sight but not identified
as one at the time (rhinos are often described as either black or white, but
they are all really gray). The purpose of this MBA elective is to understand the
variety of black swan and gray rhino events leading up to financial crises
through the lens of historical episodes and study the strategic issues that
arise in navigating them through different business situations. The cases
covered in the course discuss the impact of different kinds of crises on
acquisitions, debt restructuring, financial flexibility and portfolio management
decisions. This course is offered with [Jayanth
R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}.

**E4. Fixed Income Securities**: This MBA elective is designed to provide
theoretical and practical understanding of fixed income securities, credit risk,
and securitization both from the perspective of an investment manager or
financial intermediary and from the perspective of an issuer of these
securities. There is only very minimal coverage of fixed income derivatives and
credit derivatives. This course is offered with [Jayanth
R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}.


## O. Old or discontinued or one-off courses (in descending order of their last offering)

**O7. Financial Risk Management**: This MBA course was designed to study the
role and elements of risk management in financial institutions. After studying
the environment in which commercial banks, investment firms and hedge funds
operate in, and the need for a dedicated risk management function in large
financial institutions, the course separately discussed the practical and
regulatory issues that arise in managing different kinds of risks, in
particular, market risk, credit risk, model risk and operational risk. The focus
was on the organization of the risk management function and the evolving
regulatory landscape after the global financial crisis. The course was offered
once (with Saee Joshi, a PGP 1997 alumnus) in 2022.

**O6. Derivatives Pricing**: This PhD course was designed to provide an
introduction to the theory of derivatives pricing models in
continuous-time. Beginning with a review of relevant prerequisites, the course
first built the intuition of necessary concepts using discrete time models
before moving to derivatives pricing in continuous time using the Black-Scholes
model. The second-half of the course introduced select advanced topics including
models of jump-diffusion, fixed-income securities and stochastic volatility. The
course used a mix of readings from textbooks, review papers and select classic
papers from the field of derivatives pricing. This course was offered every year
from 2013 to 2019, with its last offering in 2019.

**O5. Analytics of Financial Risk Management**: This MBA course was designed to
provide a brief introduction to the mathematical theory of risk measures and
their applications in financial risk management. In particular, the course
covered the following topics: i) idea of risk factors and loss distributions,
ii) standard methods for market risk measurement, iii) convex and coherent risk
measures, iv) extremal risk measures, and v) Bayesian approach to risk
management. This course was offered twice, with its last offering in 2015.

**O4. Computational Finance**: This MBA course was designed to introduces
numerical methods for pricing derivative securities in practice. The focus of
the course was on the use of Monte Carlo and Finite Difference methods for
pricing equity and foreign exchange derivatives. The course ended with a
discussion of 'volatility smile' and the use of stochastic volatility models in
practice. This course was offered once (with [Jayanth
R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}), with its last offering
in 2013. A version of this course was also taught at [DAIICT,
Gandhinagar](https://www.daiict.ac.in/) in 2016.

**O1. Macroeconomics and Economic Policy**: Why do some countries grow at a
faster rate than others? Why are there inflation, unemployment and recessions?
What are the sources of these aggregate economic fluctuations? Can the
government policymakers do something about them? Should they? This course
provides a framework to start thinking about these questions. It introduces
students to the definition and measurement of aggregate variables such as income
and expenditure, inflation and unemployment, and then develop a conceptual
framework that provides insights into the determinants of these aggregate
measures that macroeconomics concerns itself with. The course will also include
an analysis of the role of government and central bank with reference to
monetary, fiscal and foreign exchange rate policies. This is a core course in
our MBA programs, and I taught this course for PGP 2011-12 and 2012-13 batches.
