## Cases and Technical Notes

**C7. Reliance Communications: On the Brink of Bankruptcy** (with [Jayanth
R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}))  

[Case no.
F&A0560](https://cases.iima.ac.in/index.php/reliance-communications-on-the-brink-of-bankruptcy.html):
This case describes the change in fortune of Reliance Communications (RCom) from
being a pioneer in offering low-cost mobile telephony to the brink of
bankruptcy. After giving a brief background on the family history of Reliance
Industries, its break-up and the launch of RCom, it describes the changing
dynamics of the Indian telecommunications industry after the launch of Reliance
Jio and the difficulties faced by RCom. As RCom's debt troubles increased, while
its stock price and its credit rating plunged, yields on its Indian Rupee bonds
barely moved. The case allows for discussing ways of implementing capital
structure arbitrage in such situations and analyze issues that arise in doing
so. The case provides data on yields on RCom's Indian Rupee and US dollar bonds
over time and provides additional relevant financial information about RCom,
including its market share, stock price, credit rating and balance sheet
variables. The case would be appropriate for use in an advanced corporate
finance or a strategic risk management or a trading strategies course.  

**C6. Swap Curve Steepener** (with [Jayanth R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}))  

[Case no.
F&A0539](https://cases.iima.ac.in/index.php/swap-curve-steepener.html): The case
is about a decision problem facing James on whether or not to invest in a
structured product called the “CMS Steepener” issued by a large US investment
bank. The payoff from the product is linked to two constant maturity swap (CMS)
rates, and the investor profits if the difference between the two CMS rates
increases, or alternatively if the CMS curve steepens. The case describes the
risks that investing in such a product poses, and presents relevant data on the
CMS rates, term structure and recent financial history of the issuer to help
resolve James’s decision problem.  

**C5. Hundred Million Dollar Beta** (with [Jayanth R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}))  

[Case
no. F&A0534](https://cases.iima.ac.in/index.php/hundred-million-dollar-beta.html):
This case is about the practical and conceptual issues involved in estimating
the beta of a company for the purpose of computing the cost of capital using the
CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). In many applications of the CAPM in the
classroom, the beta is assumed to be known or is exogenously specified. This
case is an opportunity to confront the fact that, in the real world the beta has
to be estimated and there is often a wide range of uncertainity (confidence
interval)around any point estimate of the beta. The issue that Delaware Chencery
Court Vice Chancellor Judge Travis Laster needed to resolve in October 2014 was
that the beta estimated by te plaintiff and the defendant varied so
substantially that they implied a difference of over $100 million in the
valuation of Rural-Metro. The case provides alive context to discuss conceptual
and statistical issues that are often glossed over as minor details of the
estimation process. In the real world, these apparantely minor details make a
big difference to the results and can no longer be ignored. In an advanced
course, the case also provides an opportunity to expose the participants to the
large academic literature on beta estimation.  

**C4. Swiss Roll (B)** (with [Jayanth R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}))  

[Case no. F&A0532(B)](https://cases.iima.ac.in/index.php/swiss-roll-b.html): In
the aftermath of global financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing capital flows
into Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decided to peg Swiss Franc (CHF)
to the Euro (EUR), and announced that it would not let CHF go beyond 1.20
starting 6 September, 20 11. With ever-increasing capital flows, maintaining the
peg required the SNB to purchase foreign currency assets almost endlessly, and
by the end-of 2014 its foreign exchange reserves stood at almost 80% of its
Gross Domestic Product. With the European Central Bank announcing its
"quantitative easing" program from 2015, and faced with the prospect of a
massive balance sheet, SNB finally decided to discontinue the peg starting
January 15,2015. lmmediately after the peg was removed, the CHF surged by almost
30% to EUR and this left many market participants stranded with losses worth
hundreds of millions of dollars. This case describes the market turmoil and the
main casualties after the peg was discontinued, with a focus on one particular
retail foreign exchange (FX) brokerage firm, FXCM Inc., which was left with a
negative equity of almost $300 million after removal of the peg.  
 
**C3. Swiss Roll (A)** (with [Jayanth R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}))  

[Case no. F&A0532(A)](https://cases.iima.ac.in/index.php/swiss-roll-a.html): In
September, 2011, to prevent its currency from appreciating after the Global
Financial Crisis, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decided to peg its currency to
EUR and announced that it would not let CHF go beyond 1/1.20 EUR. Maintaining
the peg required the SNB to purchase foreign currency assets virtually endlessly
in response to the worsening Eurozone crisis. By end of 2014, its foreign
currency exchange reserves amounted to almost 80% of its GDP. In an attempt to
deter capital flows and reduce its balance sheet size, in December, 2014, the
SNB first bought the interest rate on commercial bank deposits to negative
levels and then, facing impending quantitative easing by the European Central
Bank, announced the removal of the peg on January 15, 2015. The case describes
the backdrop and the circumstances leading up to removal of the peg.  

**C2. Industrial Financing Corporation of India Ltd. (IFCI) -- B** (with G. Raghuram and Chitra Singla)  

[Case no. BP0363(B)](https://cases.iima.ac.in/index.php/ifci-limited-b.html):
IFCI Limited-a non-banking financial corporation in India was struggling with
issues of negative Capital Adequacy Ratio and high non-performing assets
till 2007. The company had not done any business for a decade until 2007. July,
2007 was the time when Atul Rai joined the company as the CEO. This case
revolves around the various strategic initiatives taken by Rai and his team to
help the firm turnaround. The main focus of the case is on the implementation of
some of the key strategic decisions. The case gives opportunity to review IFCI’s
strategy and make recommendations for future expansion.  

**C1. Industrial Financing Corporation of India Ltd. (IFCI) -- A** (with G. Raghuram and Chitra Singla)  

[Case no. BP0363(A)](https://cases.iima.ac.in/index.php/ifci-limited-a.html):
This case mainly talks about the journey of IFCI since its inception amidst the
institutional changes that had taken place in India; how the changing
institutional context of an emerging economy like India could affect the growth
path of a firm in a regulated industry; and how a leadership style attempted to
turn around and build the firm's position in the industry. Atul Rai had taken a
number of initiatives in light of the above. Next on his agenda was to turn IFCI
into a leading financial institution and come up with a road map to achieve
this.  

## E. Current elective courses (in descending order of their offering)

**E5. Black Swans and Gray Rhinos**: Made popular by Nicholas Nassim Taleb,
"black swans" has long been used as a metaphor in financial markets for rare and
almost impossible-to-predict large shocks. Noticing that often many crisis are a
result of ignoring the obvious, Michel Wucker coined the "gray rhinos" metaphor
to capture that many large problems are often well in sight but not identified
as one at the time (rhinos are often described as either black or white, but
they are all really gray). The purpose of this MBA elective is to understand the
variety of black swan and gray rhino events leading up to financial crises
through the lens of historical episodes and study the strategic issues that
arise in navigating them through different business situations. The cases
covered in the course discuss the impact of different kinds of crises on
acquisitions, debt restructuring, financial flexibility and portfolio management
decisions. This course is offered with [Jayanth
R. Varma](https://www.jrvarma.in/){:target="_blank"}.
