My name is Vineet. I work at a well-known institute of management in western
India. This is a personal blog which I use to organize observations around my
research, teaching and other interests, mostly.

Do not take anything you see here too seriously (the hint lies in the blog
name!).  To borrow the words of inimitable [Mr.
Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine){:target="_blank"},
nothing here is investment or legal or career advice.
